Interactive Information Poster Assignment

## Description

I decided to make a perfectly balanced cheese, food and wine combinations with 
the most popular cheese types. These combinations are tested by gourmets and if you follow them, 
you will get an incredibly harmonious and delicious meal. This app is built with adding dynamic information on it which is retrieved from the database.

## Functionality

This is a one-page dynamic app that has a responsive design.  You can choose a certain type of cheese and depend on this cheese you will get a perfect combination with food and wine on the panel with a plate and glass in the center on the screen. The dynamic data is appeared by clicking on the "See the combination!" button.
